        <h3>Here is a little excerpt from a longer letter you will see soon:</h3>
      </div>
      <h4>sometimes i randomly remember the time you said ‚Äúi‚Äôll give you a good family‚Äù, it never fails to make me smile and feel a certain type of way. the way you said it, why you said it, and to happen to be the one you say it to is all so amazing feeling. i love every little moment we share together, i know most of it has been online at this point, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt cute. 
        i love how we‚Äôre more open now, i can talk about anything and everything without fear of being judged, and you say much too!!! much needed change as compared to how we were before.</h4>

        <h5>Here is also two journal entries of dreams I had:</h5>
        <h6 class="dam">Dream 1:</h6>
      </div>
      <p>LZMSS, familiar place.
        There was some sort of event going on, don‚Äôt remember much detail but yea, something was going on. 
        and then i forgot a chunk.
        next thing i remember, im walking up the hill in yhss, its quite late, maybe around 6(pretty dark). i see some guys walking back down, so im like, ‚Äúoh well time to leave then‚Äù, and start walking down too. for some reason, i start running, and i keep running until i reach the lmss car parking, where i find tshoki :000.
        i hug her mhmhmhm for quite a while, and we start walkingü•∞.
        we walk together across the zampa, with her arm thru mine.
        her mom comes to pick her up from under the bridge.
        end.</p>
      <h7 class="drem">Dream 2:</h7>
      <p>twas a weird dream, we were in makeshift amsterdam with our other friends.
        i came across a wes anderson style cafe.
        next scene, we were with our other friends(idk remember who) and i just leave abruptly(?), once i get pretty far away, i ask you to join me, but discreetly so the others don‚Äôt notice hehe.
        and the both of us gooooo.
        the dream i had the next day also took place in amsterdam(for part of it). for some reason, the two of us were on different flights, but we landed at amsterdam at the same time. 
        we visit a huge greenhouse, with plentiful colorful flowers, and ample sunlight. outside there‚Äôs rows and rows of beautifully colored buildings, like colorful tulips lined up in a large tulip field.
        i‚Äôd hold your hand in that place:)</p>

        I love you, tshoki:) you are the love of my life.</p>
